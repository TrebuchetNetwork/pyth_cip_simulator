Trebuchet Validator for Pyth Network
This Python script, trebuchet_validator.py, is designed to interact with the Pyth Network, simulating pricing strategies, managing stake adjustments, and logging transactions. It provides an environment to test and refine the predictions made by publishers, using real-time data fetched from the Pyth RPC.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/TrebuchetNetwork/pyth_cip_simulator
cd pyth_cip_simulator
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Tracking Length: Number of price updates to track per publisher.
Interval Duration: Frequency of data fetching from the Pyth Network.
Initial Stake: Starting stake amount for each publisher.
Symbol for Observation: Target cryptocurrency symbol, e.g., Crypto.BTC/USD.
Modify these configurations directly in the trebuchet_validator.py script as needed.

Usage
Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python trebuchet_validator.py
Key Features
Data Handling: Captures and processes real-time data from Pyth Network.
Simulation Process: Evaluates publisher predictions by comparing them against actual market prices.
Stake Adjustments: Dynamically adjusts stakes based on prediction accuracy.
Exponential Penalty Function: Applies penalties based on the severity of prediction errors.
python
Copy code
def exponential_penalty_function(outlier_number, total_price_components):
    a = 0.0000001
    b = 10 ** (2 / total_price_components)
    return a * (b ** (outlier_number - 1))
Directional Deviation Forgiveness Factor: Reduces penalties when the direction of the price movement is predicted correctly but the magnitude is off.
Transaction Logging
All transactions are logged to a file, detailing stakes transferred, bids, and prices involved. These logs provide a transparent record of all changes and are crucial for auditing and further analysis.
